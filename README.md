# Senior_Project Smart Mirror Clothing Application Recognition

This is my senior project completed in September 2020.

For the senior project class requirements - I split up each section of the projects development into seperate folders.

The final minimum viable concept was a real time clothing detection and attribute detection program that can track 
and keep track of users clothing items and their attributes for the sake of wardrobe management and clothing 
recomendation for online retailers.

Each folder contains its own readme detailing how to use the code provided.
